# React
React provides a straightforward way to handle forms using its state management system.

Form handling in React using hooks is very similar to the traditional method, but it utilizes the useState hook to manage form state. Here are the steps to
handle forms using hooks

1)Create a form component: Create a functional component that will contain the form elements.</br>
2)Create a state object: Use the useState hook to create a state object that will hold the form data.</br>
3)Add event handlers: Add event handlers to the form elements to update the state when a user enters data.</br>
4)Add a submit handler: Add a submit handler to the form that will send the form data to a server or process it in some other way.</br>
5)Connect the form elements to the state object: Connect the form elements to the state object by setting their values and onChange handlers.</br>
6)That's it! Now you have a basic form that can handle user input and submit data using React hooks. Again, there are many variations and additional
features you can add, such as validation, error handling, and conditional rendering, but this should give you a good starting point for handling forms
in React with hooks.</br>
